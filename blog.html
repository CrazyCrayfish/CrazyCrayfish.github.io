        <h1>Obama Pledges $4 Billion for CS Education</h1>
        
        <h2>2/4/16</h2>
    
        <p>Obama has pledged $4,000,000,000, yeah that's a lot of zeros, for computer science in schools because coding is everywhere. The pros of this are more educated children, a better 
        workforce in the future, all of these leading up to a better economy overall. Although a better economy and everyone knowing how to code sounds great, 4 billion is a large amount 
        and I do believe the United States is in alot of debt. The only con I see is the money. I did my research and apparently the US owes somewhere around 5 trillion dollars. 
        I don't oppose this, but neither can I say that I support it. Overall I think its a great idea, but we owe a bit too much money that I'm seeing the negative effects more than
        the positive.</p>

        <h2>2/1/16</h2>
        
        <p>I really enjoyed working on CS50x Problem Set 0, difinitely with the same ambition to make it seem like a great idea. I just winged it because what I planed to do was something
        really similar to what we do in class. Overall the process was really smooth, never encountered any bugs, stayed within my comfort zone. I think I had a great idea and making it
        come to life without too much stress was a great experience.</p>

        <h1>Day 1 of CS50X</h1>

        <h2>1/25/16</h2>

        <p>We started CS50 today and started the first lecture. The intro had some really good mixing. We learned about bits, which was the most intriguing part. The 0s and 1s 
        stand for powers of 2, going up to 256. I understood everything from the video. I feel like it's not going to be as difficult as I think it is, but it's only the first day so that statement will most likely get
        tossed out the window.</p>

        <h1>Hello World</h1>

        <h2>1/20/16</h2>

        <p>Hi my name is Timmy Tran and this is my blog. I made this blog so that myself and others can easily find my work later on in the future. I am 
        currently taking a class called Advanced Computer Science, or ACS for short. I am taking this class because I want to study computer science at a 
        faster pace. I want to complete a course called CS50 as a freshman at Alpha Cindy Avitia along with six other cool kids.</p>
        
        <p>Today was a chill day. Our first task in ACS was to build a balloon tower. We were split off into two groups: a group of four and a 
        of three. One person from each group was allowed to grab balloons from another table. Each group had to make the tallest balloon tower
        possible in 10 minutes. Instinctively, we assumed that it was a competition. At the end of the 10 minutes, the other team's tower was about
        twice as high as ours at 57 inches, which we blamed on the fact that only one person on our team could blow balloons. Our teacher, Mr. Yoho, explained 
        that he never said that it was a competition, neither did he said that the teams couldn't work together. We then had 5 minutes to work together
        to attempt to make it taller. We taped the towers together, which oddly fit perfectly, for a better foundation and built a tower that was 87 
        inches high.</p>
