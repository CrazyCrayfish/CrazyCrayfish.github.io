        <h2>1/20/16</h2>

        <p>Hi my name is Timmy Tran and this is my blog. I made this blog so that myself and others can easily find my work later on in the future. I am 
        currently taking a class called Advanced Computer Science, or ACS for short. I am taking this class because I want to study computer science at a 
        faster pace. I want to complete a course called CS50 as a freshman at Alpha Cindy Avitia along with six other cool kids.</p>
        
        <p>Today was a chill day. Our first task in ACS was to build a balloon tower. We were split off into two groups: a group of four and a 
        of three. One person from each group was allowed to grab balloons from another table. Each group had to make the tallest balloon tower
        possible in 10 minutes. Instinctively, we assumed that it was a competition. At the end of the 10 minutes, the other team's tower was about
        twice as high as ours at 57 inches, which we blamed on the fact that only one person on our team could blow balloons. Our teacher, Mr. Yoho, explained 
        that he never said that it was a competition, neither did he said that the teams couldn't work together. We then had 5 minutes to work together
        to attempt to make it taller. We taped the towers together, which oddly fit perfectly, for a better foundation and built a tower that was 87 
        inches high.</p>
